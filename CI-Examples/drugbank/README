This version is now deprecated, since it's unmaintained. @sheredom has a newer version at
https://github.com/sheredom/hashmap.h

main.c contains an example that tests the functionality of the hashmap module.
To compile it, run something like this on your system:
gcc main.c hashmap.c -o hashmaptest

There are no restrictions on how you reuse this code.
